### Access levels

Admins - Full CRUD (create, read, update, delete) access to ALL records and Users.

Users - Veterinarians and staff will be able to search, create, and update animal records. Users may delete records they created, but cannot delete records from other Vets. Users can also edit their own profile information.

### Authorization

Only authorized users may login and view the animal donor database. Authorization is handled through Passport.JS. A JSON Web Token is issued to each user upon new account, and upon login the token is verified with the database.

### User account creation JSON model example

```
firstName : Glen,
lastName : Pham,
email : glen@glen.com,
